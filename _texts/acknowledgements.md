## INTRODUCTION
After a few years in academia I am back to writing code in the hope of
getting into freelance work again. Putting together this website has been about
exercising my javascript muscles, as well as giving myself something to show to
prospective employers. As a self-taught developer, with virtually no formal
qualifications in the field in which I hope to find work, a public profile of
my work is essential. Even better to throw in some interactive visual gimicks
to pique the curiosity and stand out amongst the crowd. A kind of "Look at me,
I did this all by myself!"

But, stepping back from the mystique of self-mastery and rugged individalism
that is so (particularly) endemic in the hacker[^1] mileau, I want to talk a bit
about the social nature of coding. Of course, being social creatures in a social
world, everything we do is enabled by and inpinged upon by others. Even within
a culture such as ours, ideologically reliant on notions of individualism and
[self-someting], this is hard to deny. I want to speak quite specifically about
the worlds of software development, however, partly because it is what I'm doing
with myself at the moment, but also because here both the kinds of ideological
individualism, the nature of our interdependencies, and the conflicts between the
two, take quite interesting and specific forms.

I will start with a (very) brief history of what we can refer to as
"possessive-individualism" within hacker communities, before moving on to the
development of the Free/Open Source Software movements of the 1990s-2000s,
and finishing by looking at the current state of the collaborative ecosystems.
My hope is to cut through the bullshit on both sides (that is, the individualist
perspectives and the various shallow celebratory perspectives) and frame the
discussion using a Marxist concept of alienation. This won't be an overly
academic piece, though I do aim to provide a kind of bridge between how those of
us on the left tend to understand the nature of labour under capitalism, and how
hackers understand their own labours. Hopefully I can do so without relying to
much on the respective jargon of either side.

## POSSESSIVE INDIVIDUALISM

Hacker culture is widely seen to have grown on and around the university
campuses of places like Stanford (California) and MIT (Boston, Massachusetts)
in the late 70's and early 80's
where young students played with model railway sets and secured precious
time slots on the mainframe computers[^2].


Firmly baked into the mythos of every tech superstar are those early childhood
experiments with a screwdriver and an old radio...

The rogue vs the 'establishment man'

Dungeons and dragons - the power of magic, words against reality

Stewart Brand & Timothy Leary - (oppositional) subcultures ebrace of the PC
revolution

## THE RISE OF FOSS

The origins of FOSS coincide with the PC revolution, where the physical means of
hacking (the computers themselves) were distributed and 'liberated' frm the
'establishment man'

Richard Stallman (GNU, EFF) - early days and the moral argument for 'free software'

Linus Torvalds/Eric Raymond (Linux, Cathedral) - the capitalist justification of
open source, and the creation of GIT (and on to GitHub/ Tom Preston-Werner of
  Jekyll)

Mozilla/ Brendan Eich - Brief summary of firefox's fight for a competetive web
ecosystem, including the original standard for javascript etc (noting how
  differently how things could have played out )

## UNALIENATED LABOUR
Start by looking at what we lost with the creation of the
'platform web'. Was Mozilla's intervention wasted/doomed frm the start?

Power of Netorks - political liberalism attempts to take up the question.

Paul Mason - One response from the left has been an uncritical celebration of
these new forms of collabration. A new class of creative workers, enabled by
technological advances and the internal dynamics of capitalism  will bring about
the downfall of our world order and usher in our 'post-capitalist' future.
Similarly, the authors behind 'The Accelerationist Manifesto', fueled by
hyperbole and techno-fetishism, envision a....

But where does struggle fit into these pictures? The struggles that have brought
 us to this juncture, from Eich's battles with Netscape or Stallman's struggles
 with his university print shop,

## CONCLUSION
So here I am tapping away in an open source text editor on Ubuntu Linux,
uploading my work to public repository on GitHub.com, which essentially
socialises the cost of hosting.


[^1]: I use the term hacker in the broader sense of "A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and stretching their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary."

[^2]: Stephen Levy's book 'Hackers' is a classic of this history, and is well worth a read for anyone interested
